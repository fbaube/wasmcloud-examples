# Go HTTP Client

[This example](https://github.com/fbaube/wasmCloud/examples/component/http-client)
is a WebAssembly component that calls a random
number generator service to get random numbers.

The application...

- Implements a [`wasi:http`][wasi-http]-compliant HTTP handler
- Uses the [`httpserver` provider][httpserver-provider] to serve requests
- Can be declaratively provisioned in a [wasmCloud][wasmCloud] environment

[wasi-http]: https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-http
[httpserver-provider]: https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmCloud/tree/main/crates/provider-http-server

## üì¶ Dependencies

Go 1.23+, tinygo, [`wasm-tools`](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-tools#installation), [wasmCloud Shell (`wash`)](https://wasmcloud.com/docs/installation) 

## üëü Run the example

Clone the [wasmCloud/go repository](https://github.com/wasmcloud/go): 

```shell
git clone https://github.com/wasmCloud/go.git
```

Change directory to `examples/component/http-client`:

```shell
cd examples/component/http-client
```

### Start a local development loop

Run `wash dev` to start a local development loop:

```shell
wash dev
```

The `wash dev` command will:

- Start a local wasmCloud environment
- Build this component
- Deploy your app and all requirements to run it locally, including...
  - Your locally built component
  - The [HTTP server provider][httpserver-provider], which will
    receive requests from the outside world (on port 8000 by default)
  - The [HTTP client provider][httpclient-provider], which will
    call a random number generator service
  - Necessary links between providers and your component so your
    component can handle web traffic
- Watch your code for changes and re-deploy when necessary.

Use `wash app list` to check for `Deployed` status:

```shell
wash app list
```

### Send a request

When you send a request, the component will call an
upstream API and return a list of random numbers:

```shell
curl localhost:8000
```
```text
[438,424,166,260,681]
```

### Clean up

You can stop the `wash dev` process with `Ctrl-C`.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues/FAQ

### `curl` produces a "failed to invoke" error

If `curl`ing produces...

```text
failed to invoke `wrpc:http/incoming-handler.handle`: failed
to invoke `wrpc:http/incoming-handler@0.1.0.handle`: failed
to shutdown synchronous parameter channel: not connected%
```

...the HTTP server may not have finished starting up. You can check
that the application has reached `Deployed` status with `wash app list`. 

If the issue persists, you may have a lingering HTTP server provider
running on your system. You can use `pgrep` to check:

```shell
pgrep -la ghcr_io
```
```text
